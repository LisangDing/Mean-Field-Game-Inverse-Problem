# Mean-Field-Game-Inverse-Problem
In this repository, we give the codes for our paper "A Mean Field Game Inverse Problem". [1]

# Data generation
We generate the data by numerically solving a forward problem. We use a primal-dual approach to solve the forward problem. The corresponding code is "EMD_forward_2D.m". It generates the 2D datas for Test 1 in [1]. The data will then be saved in "forward_data_2D.mat".
