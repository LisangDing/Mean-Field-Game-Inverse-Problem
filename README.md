# Mean-Field-Game-Inverse-Problem
In this repository, we give the codes for our paper "A Mean Field Game Inverse Problem". [1]

# Overview
Overall, we have codes for reconstructing ground metric and convolution kernel in both 1D and 2D cases. Different tasks are compiled in distinguishing folders. In each folder, there is a "MFG_forward.m" file. It can generate the data for our inverse problem. In the same folder, there is a **"MFG_backward.m"** file, which is the core file for performing inverse problem algorithms. The generated data is stored in **forward_data.mat**. The **"MFG_backward.m"** file can only work when there is data either generated by "MFG_forward.m" or input externally in the folder.

# Noise on data
In the provided code, all the forward data generated is not noisy. Noise can be added to the corresponding variables "rho", "v", which serve as observations for the inverse problem.

# Rough estimation of the running time
We note that the expected running time for each task is as follows, 
| Task      | Dimension | Time decay |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| ground metric     | 1D       | ~1 min |
| kernel     | 1D       | ~1 hour |
| ground metric     | 2D       | ~10 hours |
| kernel     | 2D       | ~10 hours |
